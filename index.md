I'm a software engineer at [Citizen](https://www.citizen.com), having previously been a software engineer and data scientist at [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com). My background is in public policy and urban planning, and I found my way to programming through mapping and geospatial analysis. [Here](http://pavementtoparks.org/wp-content/uploads//2015/12/PAE-Ben-Weinryb-Grohsgal.pdf) is my master's thesis. [Here](http://benwg.com/postcards/) is an old project that was a lot of fun. In my free time I draw monsters, hike, and make things.
